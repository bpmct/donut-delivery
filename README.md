# donut-delivery

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: this app is incomplete, do not use it in production!**

---

A React (Next.js) donut delivery app. This app uses [BuiltOn](https://builton.dev) and their JavaScript SDK in order to manage app data such as:

- Users (‚ÜîÔ∏è with Firebase Auth)
- Products (donuts in this case üç©)
- Discount coupons
- Orders
- Payments (‚ÜîÔ∏è with Stripe)

## Installation

Long installs stuck. Especially if you just want to start playing around. We're planning on making a simple script that makes it easy to start coding üòä

For now though, here's what you have to do:

- Create a [free BuiltOn account](https://builton.dev)
- Create a [Google Firebase project](https://firebase.com) and link it in to your BuiltOn dashboard.
- Configure Firebase Auth to accept Google logins & guest accounts
- Clone this repo and `npm install`
- You can configure the app with environment variables or create a `.env` file in the project root.
  ```
  BUILTON_APIKEY=
  FIREBASE_APIKEY=
  FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN:
  FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL:
  ```
- Add some products in the [BuiltOn Dashboard](https://dashboard.builton.dev/order_process/products) to make things more interesting
- Start developing with `npm run dev`

‚Ñπ Disclaimer: I do consulting work for BuiltOn and needed to make a delivery app for my friend's donut shop. I figured making it open source would be a fun way to show BuiltOn's capabilities! üòÅ
